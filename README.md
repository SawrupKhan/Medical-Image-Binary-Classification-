Take Your First Step in Medical Image Classification

Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining importance day by day in healthcare. Again, Deep already shows its superhuman accuracy on image classification. So, AI enthusiasts are jumping to develop computer-aided detection systems to diagnose various diseases. Today, We will build a model to detect pediatric/child pneumonia. This kernel is for beginners who want to jump in medical image classification. We will pick a dataset containing pneumonia (bacterial and viral) and normal images. We will do binary (two-class) classification so our model will detect pneumonia from the test set. Data load and preprocessing, Training, and evaluation are basic steps of any classification model. We will follow these steps. There are various ways to preprocess any dataset. I want to do it an easy way so we think beginners can easily understand it. Beginners should follow the comments for better understanding. If you don't understand anything or you have more queries, feel free to contact me. Email: khanfmonowar@gmail.com
